The sump oil level control has a small float controlling a relay valve to control an oil level control valve connecting an elevated oil reservoir for gravity feed to fill the sump and pressure return to the reservoir to dump the sump. When the transmission input and pump is not driven, there is no pressure in the chambers at opposite ends of the differential land area level valve and balanced springs hold the level valve in a central closed position blocking flow to and from the reservoir, to the sump and from the pressure line so the oil level control is inoperative. When the transmission input is driven, a small flow of line pressure is supplied through an inlet restriction to each chamber. When the oil level is low, a miniature float provides a small force to close the miniature relay valve closing a restricted exhaust from the chamber at the larger area land so equal pressures in the chambers act on the differential land area to move the level valve to the fill position closing the supply pressure port and providing a full flow connection from the reservoir for gravity feed at a low volume rate of flow to the sump. When the oil level is high the float permits the pressure to open the relay valve and the restricted exhaust reduces the pressure in the larger area chamber to move the level valve to dump position closing the sump port and connecting a restricted supply pressure branch to the reservoir so the transmission pump delivers fluid at the same low volume rate of flow from the sump to the reservoir to reduce the oil level.

The body garment will give the upper body muscles of the back and abdomen pressure support controlled by the fasteners.,Orthopedic belt: A lumbosacral support system comprising a belt and an orthopedic pad carried by the belt. The pad has a contoured template surface with a transversely extending central trough portion for accommodating the protruding spinal processes of the wearer when the pad is pressed against the lumbar region, and a pair of raised plateau regions flanking the central trough portion for contacting the erector spinae muscles of the wearer to provide support. The template surface of the pad has a vertical surface contour through the central region approximating the average lordotic curve of a wearer. The belt is longitudinally tapered so the pad is arranged at an angle to vertical to optimally engage the lumbar region of the wearer.,Neuromuscular reflex assessment method: Studies investigating posteroanterior (PA) forces in spinal stiffness assessment have shown relationships to spinal level, body type, and lumbar extensor muscle activity. Little objective evidence is available discerning variation in PA stiffness and its clinical significance. The aim of this prospective clinical study was to determine the stiffness index and neuromuscular characteristics of the asymptomatic and symptomatic low back. Twenty-two subject underwent physical examination and completed outcome VAS, Oswestry, and SF-36 questionnaires. A hand-held spinal manipulation instrument, equipped with a load cell and accelerometer was used to deliver high rate (<0.1 sec) PA manipulative thrusts (450 N) to several common spinal landmarks including the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS), sacral base, and L5, L4, L2, T12, T8 spinous (SP) and transverse processes (TP). Surface, linear enveloped, electromyographic (sEMG) recordings were obtained during the trusts from electrodes (8 leads) located over the L3 and L5 erector spinae. The accelerance (peak acceleration/peak force, kg&#8722;1) or stiffness index and composite sEMG response was calculated for each of the trusts. Significantly increased SP stiffness (7.0 kg&#8722;1) (P<0.05) and a more positive sEMG response was found in subjects with frequent or constant LBP symptoms in comparison to SP stiffness (6.5 kg&#8722;1) of subjects with lesser symptom frequency. A positive sEMG response was associated with a significant increase (P<0.05) in the TP stiffness response to PA thrusts in comparison to negative neuromuscular responders. The average SP stiffness was 6.6% greater (P<0.05) and 19.1% greater (P<<0.001) than the average SI stiffness and average TP stiffness, respectfully.
Methods of and/or apparatus for joining timber members: A method and apparatus for end jointing timber members such as floor or ceiling joists by means of spiked timber connector plates, using apparatus incorporating equipment to position and hold the timber and automatically feed connector plates from cassettes or magazines holding a supply of connector plates onto magnetized pressing platens which then rotate to position the connector plates to span the joint to be made before passing the spikes into the relevant timber members.,Multiple station plastic pipe belling machine: A multiple station plastic pipe belling machine in which an endless conveyor periodically receives one of a series of plastic pipes as each pipe is dumped from a V-trough receiving such pipes in sequence after their extrusion and cutting into predetermined pipe lengths, disposes the pipes so received parallel to, but spaced from, each other and advances the thus-disposed pipes in predetermined increments; positions the pipes in such a manner that their ends to be belled are first passed in such increments through a heater adjacent the edge of the endless conveyor, while the pipes are continuously rotated until each pipe passes out of the heater and is then carried in such increments by the endless conveyor into the first of a plurality of belling stations where a pair of semi-circular clamps encircle the pipe end and a mandrel or plug is inserted therein. After insertion of the plug, the clamps are removed and the thus-plugged pipe is further moved incrementally through several additional belling machine stations in a cooling area until the pipe end is sufficiently cooled, whereupon the plug is withdrawn so that the pipe may be further advanced by the endless conveyor for discharge from the machine. As soon as one pipe is moved into the cooling area from this first clamping and plugging station, the next pipe is clamped and belled in that station. The plugs project from blocks which, after first being moved into the first station transversely to the path of the pipe end carried by the endless conveyor, thereby to enable the plug to be inserted in a pipe end, are then moved along the incremental path of the pipe end to the last belling station, whereupon the block is moved back transversely from and out of said path to a point behind the other blocks so that it may be shifted back behind the other blocks to a position for removement back into the first station. All movements of the machine are synchronized through appropriate clutching, gearing, sprocket and chain devices, and this synchronism is characterized by being of predictable and repeatable time span.,Gas analyzer: A multiple gas analyzer is disclosed utilizing the infrared absorption principle for determining the quantity of two or more gases with a sample tube and a reference tube in parallel orientation with an infrared source between one end of the two tubes, and an infrared detector assembly between the other end of the tubes. Immediately opposed to each end of the tubes are a pair of mirrors, one being a transmitting mirror remote from the infrared source and directing the infrared beam in parallel paths through the reference tube and sample tube, and a receiving mirror opposite the infrared detector assembly to focus the infrared beam after passing through the tubes on to the infrared detectors. A chopper disc is interposed between the infrared source and the transmitting mirror to provide intermittently direct pulses to the infrared beam through the reference tube and sample tube to the infrared detectors, and a circuit is provided to compare the differential of signal strength from the two signals generated by each of the detectors and to calibrate the same with regard to the gas content being read. Filters are provided in the infrared detector assembly for that particular wave length in which the gas finds its signature for photon absorption. In the circuit, provision is made to first calibrate the unit for ambient variables, and thereafter to calibrate the unit against a factory determined span gas sample by means of vignetting the sample chamber to simulate a convenient up-scale reading of the particular gas being calibrated. Further adjustment is provided for comparing the high scale with the low scale in the course of sampling to thereby fully calibrate the unit and check the same during its operation.,System and method for xenon acceleration in training simulator for nuclear power plant: A method and system for the real-time dynamic simulation of a nuclear power plant that includes a control and monitoring console for operating the reactor and monitoring three dimensional physical values, such as nuclear flux, power and temperature throughout the core. A digital computer is connected to the console to calculate the physical values in real-time, with such calculations including the effect of xenon on the output and distribution of the power in the core. The method and system also provides for accelerating the xenon effect to provide for accurate simulation in real-time without the necessity of operating the simulator continuously through the preselected time span.,Anti-sag device for paper mill showers: An elongated shower pipe, extending across a paper stock treatment machine, such as a Fourdrinier, instead of being a uniformly simply supported span, is supported on brackets at each end designed to significantly reduce the deflection of the shower pipe. The brackets include fixed supports inboard of the ends and deflection means, outboard of the supports, which apply a moment of force in a direction opposite to the forces exerted by the gravity on the central span of the pipe. Threaded means adjusts the amount of anti-sag force.
